This is a pre-compiled version of snappy 1.0.5 from 
http://code.google.com/p/snappy/downloads/detail?name=snappy-1.0.5.tar.gz

This is compiled using gcc-4.6.2-glibc-2.13 on centos5.2
and uses jemalloc. This is here so that one can compile leveldb to use
snappy easily. 

To compile,:
cd ./snappy-1.0.5
execute either make or compile.sh. 
This will create *.so and *.a in snappy-1.0.5/.libs. 

run unit tests:
./snappy-1.0.5/snappy_unittest
